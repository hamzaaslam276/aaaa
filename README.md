# Wine Classification Using Decision Tree

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying wines into one of three classes (Class 0, Class 1, or Class 2) based on their chemical properties using a Decision Tree algorithm. The model is trained on the Wine dataset, which contains various chemical features of different wine samples.

## 🎯 Objective
- Build a machine learning model to classify wines.
- Train the model using chemical properties as features.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy in predicting the correct wine class.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [UCI Wine Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aarontanjaya/uci-wine-dataset). It contains multiple features related to wine composition, such as alcohol content, acidity, and phenols.

## 🏗️ Methodology
1. **Load the Dataset**: Extract wine data and corresponding class labels.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Prepare the dataset for training by splitting into training and testing sets.
3. **Train a Decision Tree Classifier**: Fit the model on the training data.
4. **Evaluate the Model**: Measure accuracy and generate a classification report.

## 📊 Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **94.44%**, demonstrating high performance in predicting the correct wine class.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Implement other classification models such as Random Forest or Support Vector Machines (SVM) for comparison.
- Perform feature selection to optimize model performance.
- Tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.
